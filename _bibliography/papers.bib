Introduction Antibiotic resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) is a global public health challenge; resistance has emerged to all antibiotics used for empirical treatment. In Switzerland, gonorrhoea reports increased from 404 in 2000 to 1895 in 2015, with about 40\% in men who have sex with men (MSM). To our knowledge, no studies have examined factors associated with antibiotic resistant NG in Switzerland. Methods We enrolled MSM at clinics in Zürich and Bern from May 2015 to June 2016 presenting with symptoms suggestive of NG, partners of known cases or had a positive NG screening test. MSM completed an online questionnaire on social and behavioural factors and physicians completed a case report form. Specimens from pharynx, rectum and urethra were tested with a molecular test and culture. For culture positive specimens, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for different antibiotics was determined, using EUCAST 2017 resistance breakpoints for ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefixime and spectinomycin, and ≥2mg/L for azithromycin (as in a European study). We also examined reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone (cutoff ≥0.016 mg/L). Cases were MSM with NG and MIC above the breakpoint, controls were MSM with NG and MIC less than or equal to the breakpoint. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Results In total, 164/230 (71\%) MSM were positive for NG; culture was positive in 118/164. We compared 45 (39\%) cases with ciprofloxacin resistance with 73 controls. Cases were more likely than controls to have concurrent sexual partners (OR 2.2, 95\%Cl 0.876.0, p=0.13), to have received oral sex (OR 5.3, 0.644.2, p=0.08), to have had sex abroad in the last three months (OR 2.3, 1.04.9, p=0.08) and for the most recent partner to be casual (OR 2.6, 0.88.5 p=0.08). One NG isolate was azithromycin resistant. No isolates were resistant to spectinomycin, cefixime or ceftriaxone; 21 (18\%) had reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone, but we found no associations with clinical or behavioural factors. Conclusions This study had a limited sample size but is the first in Switzerland to link behavioural factors with antibiotic resistant NG. Ciprofloxacin resistance was common in MSM and there is evidence of reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone. Interventions for MSM to promote safer sex, especially whilst abroad, and enhanced surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility could help to identify and control emerging resistance in NG.},

              Cefepime is frequently prescribed to treat infections caused by AmpC-producing Gram-negative bacteria. CMY-2 is the most common plasmid-mediated AmpC (pAmpC) β-lactamase. Unfortunately, CMY variants conferring enhanced cefepime resistance have been reported. Here, we describe the evolution of CMY-2 to an extended-spectrum AmpC (ESAC) in clonally identical
              Escherichia coli
              isolates obtained from a patient. The CMY-2-producing
              E. coli
              isolate (CMY-2-
              Ec
              ) was isolated from a wound. Thirty days later, one CMY-33-producing
              E. coli
              isolate (CMY-33-
              Ec
              ) was detected in a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sample. Two weeks before the isolation of CMY-33-
              Ec
              , the patient received cefepime. CMY-33-
              Ec
              and CMY-2-
              Ec
              were identical by repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR (rep-PCR), being of hyperepidemic sequence type 131 (ST131) but showing different β-lactam MICs (e.g., cefepime MIC, 16 and ≤0.5 μg/ml for CMY-33-
              Ec
              and CMY-2-
              Ec
              , respectively). Identical CMY-2-
              Ec
              isolates were also found in a rectal swab. CMY-33 differs from CMY-2 by a Leu293-Ala294 deletion. Expressed in
              E. coli
              strain DH10B, both CMYs conferred resistance to ceftazidime (≥256 μg/ml), but the cefepime MICs were higher for CMY-33 than CMY-2 (8 versus 0.25 μg/ml, respectively). The
              k
              cat
              /

              or inhibitor complex inactivation (
              k
              inact
              )/

              s
              −1
              ) indicated that CMY-33 possesses an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-like spectrum compared to that of CMY-2 (e.g., cefoxitin, 0.2 versus 0.4; ceftazidime, 0.2 versus not measurable; cefepime, 0.2 versus not measurable; and tazobactam, 0.0018 versus 0.0009, respectively). Using molecular modeling, we show that a widened active site (∼4-Å shift) may play a significant role in enhancing cefepime hydrolysis. This is the first
              in vivo
              demonstration of a pAmpC that under cephalosporin treatment expands its substrate spectrum, resembling an ESBL. The prevalence of CMY-2-
              Ec
              isolates is rapidly increasing worldwide; therefore, awareness that cefepime treatment may select for resistant isolates is critical.},

            ABSTRACT
            
              Molecular methods are often used for
              Neisseria gonorrhoeae
              detection, but complete definition of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns still requires phenotypic tests. We developed an assay that both identifies
              N. gonorrhoeae
              and detects AMR determinants in clinical specimens. We designed a mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA)-based SYBR green real-time PCR targeting one
              N. gonorrhoeae
              -specific region (
              opa
              ); mosaic
              penA
              alleles (Asp345 deletion [Asp345del], Gly545Ser) associated with decreased susceptibility to cephalosporins; and alterations conferring resistance to ciprofloxacin (GyrA Ser91Phe), azithromycin (23S rRNA A2059G and C2611T), and spectinomycin (16S rRNA C1192T). We applied the real-time PCR to 489 clinical specimens, of which 94 had paired culture isolates, and evaluated its performance by comparison with the performance of commercial diagnostic molecular and phenotypic tests. Our assay exhibited a sensitivity/specificity of 93\%/100\%, 96\%/85\%, 90\%/91\%, 100\%/100\%, and 100\%/90\% for the detection of
              N. gonorrhoeae
              directly from urethral, rectal, pharyngeal, cervical, and vaginal samples, respectively. The MAMA strategy allowed the detection of AMR mutations by comparing cycle threshold values with the results of the reference
              opa
              reaction. The method accurately predicted the phenotype of resistance to four antibiotic classes, as determined by comparison with the MIC values obtained from 94 paired cultures (sensitivity/specificity for cephalosporins, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and spectinomycin resistance, 100\%/95\%, 100\%/100\%, 100\%/100\%, and not applicable [NA]/100\%, respectively, in genital specimens and NA/72\%, NA/98\%, 100\%/97\%, and NA/96\%, respectively, in extragenital specimens). False-positive results, particularly for the
              penA
              Asp345del reaction, were observed predominantly in pharyngeal specimens. Our real-time PCR assay is a promising rapid method to identify
              N. gonorrhoeae
              and predict AMR directly in genital specimens, but further optimization for extragenital specimens is needed.},

              Resistance to antibiotics used against
              Neisseria gonorrhoeae
              infections is a major public health concern. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) testing relies on time-consuming culture-based methods. Development of rapid molecular tests for detection of AMR determinants could provide valuable tools for surveillance and epidemiological studies and for informing individual case management. We developed a fast ({\textless}1.5-h) SYBR green-based real-time PCR method with high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. One triplex and three duplex reactions included two sequences for
              N. gonorrhoeae
              identification and seven determinants of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs), azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and spectinomycin. The method was validated by testing 39 previously fully characterized
              N. gonorrhoeae
              strains, 19 commensal
              Neisseria
              species strains, and an additional panel of 193 gonococcal isolates. Results were compared with results of culture-based AMR determination. The assay correctly identified
              N. gonorrhoeae
              and the presence or absence of the seven AMR determinants. There was some cross-reactivity with nongonococcal
              Neisseria
              species, and the detection limit was 10
              3
              to 10
              4
              genomic DNA (gDNA) copies/reaction. Overall, the platform accurately detected resistance to ciprofloxacin (sensitivity and specificity, 100\%), ceftriaxone (sensitivity, 100\%; specificity, 90\%), cefixime (sensitivity, 92\%; specificity, 94\%), azithromycin (sensitivity and specificity, 100\%), and spectinomycin (sensitivity and specificity, 100\%). In conclusion, our methodology accurately detects mutations that generate resistance to antibiotics used to treat gonorrhea. Low assay sensitivity prevents direct diagnostic testing of clinical specimens, but this method can be used to screen collections of gonococcal isolates for AMR more quickly than current culture-based AMR testing.},
