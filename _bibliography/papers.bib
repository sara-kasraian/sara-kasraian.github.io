  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Resistance to antibiotics used against               Neisseria gonorrhoeae               infections is a major public health concern. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) testing relies on time-consuming culture-based methods. Development of rapid molecular tests for detection of AMR determinants could provide valuable tools for surveillance and epidemiological studies and for informing individual case management. We developed a fast ({$<$}1.5-h) SYBR green-based real-time PCR method with high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. One triplex and three duplex reactions included two sequences for               N. gonorrhoeae               identification and seven determinants of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs), azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and spectinomycin. The method was validated by testing 39 previously fully characterized               N. gonorrhoeae               strains, 19 commensal               Neisseria               species strains, and an additional panel of 193 gonococcal isolates. Results were compared with results of culture-based AMR determination. The assay correctly identified               N. gonorrhoeae               and the presence or absence of the seven AMR determinants. There was some cross-reactivity with nongonococcal               Neisseria               species, and the detection limit was 10               3               to 10               4               genomic DNA (gDNA) copies/reaction. Overall, the platform accurately detected resistance to ciprofloxacin (sensitivity and specificity, 100\%), ceftriaxone (sensitivity, 100\%; specificity, 90\%), cefixime (sensitivity, 92\%; specificity, 94\%), azithromycin (sensitivity and specificity, 100\%), and spectinomycin (sensitivity and specificity, 100\%). In conclusion, our methodology accurately detects mutations that generate resistance to antibiotics used to treat gonorrhea. Low assay sensitivity prevents direct diagnostic testing of clinical specimens, but this method can be used to screen collections of gonococcal isolates for AMR more quickly than current culture-based AMR testing.},

We developed an assay that both identifies               N. gonorrhoeae               and detects AMR determinants in clinical specimens.                        ,              ABSTRACT                            Molecular methods are often used for               Neisseria gonorrhoeae               detection, but complete definition of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns still requires phenotypic tests. We developed an assay that both identifies               N. gonorrhoeae               and detects AMR determinants in clinical specimens. We designed a mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA)-based SYBR green real-time PCR targeting one               N. gonorrhoeae               -specific region (               opa               ); mosaic               penA               alleles (Asp345 deletion [Asp345del], Gly545Ser) associated with decreased susceptibility to cephalosporins; and alterations conferring resistance to ciprofloxacin (GyrA Ser91Phe), azithromycin (23S rRNA A2059G and C2611T), and spectinomycin (16S rRNA C1192T). We applied the real-time PCR to 489 clinical specimens, of which 94 had paired culture isolates, and evaluated its performance by comparison with the performance of commercial diagnostic molecular and phenotypic tests. Our assay exhibited a sensitivity/specificity of 93\%/100\%, 96\%/85\%, 90\%/91\%, 100\%/100\%, and 100\%/90\% for the detection of               N. gonorrhoeae               directly from urethral, rectal, pharyngeal, cervical, and vaginal samples, respectively. The MAMA strategy allowed the detection of AMR mutations by comparing cycle threshold values with the results of the reference               opa               reaction. The method accurately predicted the phenotype of resistance to four antibiotic classes, as determined by comparison with the MIC values obtained from 94 paired cultures (sensitivity/specificity for cephalosporins, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and spectinomycin resistance, 100\%/95\%, 100\%/100\%, 100\%/100\%, and not applicable [NA]/100\%, respectively, in genital specimens and NA/72\%, NA/98\%, 100\%/97\%, and NA/96\%, respectively, in extragenital specimens). False-positive results, particularly for the               penA               Asp345del reaction, were observed predominantly in pharyngeal specimens. Our real-time PCR assay is a promising rapid method to identify               N. gonorrhoeae               and predict AMR directly in genital specimens, but further optimization for extragenital specimens is needed.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Cefepime is frequently prescribed to treat infections caused by AmpC-producing Gram-negative bacteria. CMY-2 is the most common plasmid-mediated AmpC (pAmpC) β-lactamase. Unfortunately, CMY variants conferring enhanced cefepime resistance have been reported. Here, we describe the evolution of CMY-2 to an extended-spectrum AmpC (ESAC) in clonally identical               Escherichia coli               isolates obtained from a patient. The CMY-2-producing               E. coli               isolate (CMY-2-               Ec               ) was isolated from a wound. Thirty days later, one CMY-33-producing               E. coli               isolate (CMY-33-               Ec               ) was detected in a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sample. Two weeks before the isolation of CMY-33-               Ec               , the patient received cefepime. CMY-33-               Ec               and CMY-2-               Ec               were identical by repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR (rep-PCR), being of hyperepidemic sequence type 131 (ST131) but showing different β-lactam MICs (e.g., cefepime MIC, 16 and ≤0.5 μg/ml for CMY-33-               Ec               and CMY-2-               Ec               , respectively). Identical CMY-2-               Ec               isolates were also found in a rectal swab. CMY-33 differs from CMY-2 by a Leu293-Ala294 deletion. Expressed in               E. coli               strain DH10B, both CMYs conferred resistance to ceftazidime (≥256 μg/ml), but the cefepime MICs were higher for CMY-33 than CMY-2 (8 versus 0.25 μg/ml, respectively). The               k               cat               /                                K                 m                              or inhibitor complex inactivation (               k               inact               )/                                K                 i                              app               (μM               −1               s               −1               ) indicated that CMY-33 possesses an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-like spectrum compared to that of CMY-2 (e.g., cefoxitin, 0.2 versus 0.4; ceftazidime, 0.2 versus not measurable; cefepime, 0.2 versus not measurable; and tazobactam, 0.0018 versus 0.0009, respectively). Using molecular modeling, we show that a widened active site (∼4-Å shift) may play a significant role in enhancing cefepime hydrolysis. This is the first               in vivo               demonstration of a pAmpC that under cephalosporin treatment expands its substrate spectrum, resembling an ESBL. The prevalence of CMY-2-               Ec               isolates is rapidly increasing worldwide; therefore, awareness that cefepime treatment may select for resistant isolates is critical.},
